Self driving cars face a lot of problems. Obstacles, reacting to unpredicatability, coordinating with other cars.
But whagt if all the cars were on a grid and everythig is controlled by one AI. (Like future cities in the space) 
Would coordination be easier? No unpredictable events? No accidents?
What about pedestrains? Would they use rovers too? Would these rovers be connected to the same AI?
Is this the only way self driving cars will be completely foolproof?
Detail out thought processes, put them down and explore all possibilities and scenarios.
